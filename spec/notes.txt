Professor Appointment:
- Next week

TODO for next week:
- Research questions/notes:
 - Given a random distribution of passengers in a bus/air-train system, we should determine how many buses/trams are needed.
 - How many buses/trams needed to avoid overcrowding on queues.
 - How can we model passengers (stop they get on, and off)
 - Contained environment, buses/trams travel in sequential.
 - Looking at real world data for how often passengers queue?
 - Look into JFK open data?

Notes from Jean's meeting with professor:

We may need to change what we want to measure, because 'how many buses are needed to effectively service all of the passengers' are measuring and analyzing, hence an optimization problem, which we don't have much knowledge of. Simulation would be more of modeling a behavior of certain phenomenon using a few choice parameters, with number of trials and difference scenario.
But still she liked our idea of bus routing.
- TODO: Come up with another question that answers what our model does
  - How is wait time affected by the frequency of buses
  - How is TRAVEL time ...
  - Model different bus sizes, different queue, traffic
There are no real difference between models for a bus route and an air train (so no point going through 'simpler' model)
- Ok
We should start with DES (with possibility of continuous model later)
- Ok
# of bus = frequency
- Ok
Keep the arrival rate to be constant as it adds complexity if it is random.
- A distribution model (standard distribution, poisson, etc...)
Consider using markov chain with stationary probability (for arrival rate?)
- The arrival of passangers and their travel time should not impact across state.
Decide on one parameter we want to control/measure (frequency?)
- Waiting time

Simulation should be able to adapt to the input parameters. However, using real life data might not be good idea as such data contains irregularity and defects that would eat up our time just dealing with it. In order to verify the validity of our model, it would be just analyze the model itself.
QUESTION: how much weight are we giving to parameters used? (wait time, overcrowding)
QUESTION: do you want to control 'headway'?
- What's a 'headway'?
QUESTION: what deliverables would we be required of? (ANSWER: 1. description/definition of model for our simulation, 2. explanation on why we choose such that model, 3. control measures, 4. performance measures; please see the class website for the project presentation example and template)

TODO: Look up these KEYWORDS: headway, ghost simulation, origin destination matrix

DELIVERABLES:
- Explain in detail what models we used
- What were our outcomes.

Presentation/Meeting Notes with Professor:

- Topic: Simulating an closed bus route/terminal with multiple stops.
- Question: Given a distribution of passengers arriving, how many buses are needed to effectiently service all of the passangers?
 - Effectiently: To not have a wait time of more than X mins for any passangers.
 - Study of how the model would change if we were to change:
  - The frequency of passangers arriving.
  - Number of stops/multiple routes
  - Adding other factors such as express/local bus services, etc...
- Modeling:
 - How can we effectively model this bus route?
 - How to model the different events.
 - Choosing the right model (DES, tick based, etc...) for different parts of the simulation.
- Measuring our results/presentation of findings:
 - What determines the effectiveness of our model?
 - And how to measure the effectiveness of our model?
 - How/what can we present to display the effectiveness of our model?
