Professor Appointment:
- Next week

TODO for next week:
- Research questions/notes:
 - Given a random distribution of passengers in a bus/air-train system, we should determine how many buses/trams are needed.
 - How many buses/trams needed to avoid overcrowding on queues.
 - How can we model passengers (stop they get on, and off)
 - Contained environment, buses/trams travel in sequential.
 - Looking at real world data for how often passengers queue?
 - Look into JFK open data?

Presentation/Meeting Notes with Professor:

- Topic: Simulating an closed bus route/terminal with multiple stops.
- Question: Given a distribution of passengers arriving, how many buses are needed to effectiently service all of the passangers?
 - Effectiently: To not have a wait time of more than X mins for any passangers.
 - Study of how the model would change if we were to change:
  - The frequency of passangers arriving.
  - Number of stops/multiple routes
  - Adding other factors such as express/local bus services, etc...
- Modeling:
 - How can we effectively model this bus route?
 - How to model the different events.
 - Choosing the right model (DES, tick based, etc...) for different parts of the simulation.
- Measuring our results/presentation of findings:
 - What determines the effectiveness of our model?
 - And how to measure the effectiveness of our model?
 - How/what can we present to display the effectiveness of our model?
